### 2024 BIG DATA HACKATHON PROPOSAL FORM

#### Team Number: `Team 123`  

#### Team Name: `Desi Boys`    
  
#### Hackathon idea in One sentence:
##### `Mental health challenges often go undetected in patients, significantly impacting their overall well-being and quality of life. Clinicians struggle to accurately assess and monitor mental health due to a lack of real-time data and culturally relevant interventions. To address this issue, we propose an AI-driven solution that integrates Indian Yoga techniques and meditation practices into a holistic mental health management system. This system will enable clinicians to effectively monitor and assess patients’ mental health by leveraging real-time physiological data, emotional analytics, and personalized Yoga and meditation recommendations, ultimately improving mental health outcomes and fostering a deeper understanding of patients' needs.`
